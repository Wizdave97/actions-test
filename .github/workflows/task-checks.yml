# To enable this workflow create a file in thge root of the repo called CHECKLIST.yml
# The only key supported in that file is the paths key
# Each key under paths creates a checklist with those questions 
# whenever any file that matches that path is updated in the PR
# paths:
#   "/**":
#     - Did you remember to link time doctor tasks?
#     - Does PR have task link?
#     - Have you recorded a loom video demoing new features added?
#     - Are all tests passing?
#   "src/components/**.ts":
#     - Did you check that the component visual look still matches design documents?
#   "docs/**":
#     - Did you update the README?
